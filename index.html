    <p> Hello y'all! My name is Letitia Soberanis but, everyone calls me Tee...for obvious reasons! I am a 39 year old, single mother of four. I am still a resident of my hometown, the beautiful Charleston, South Carolina! In my free time, I enjoy shoppping, cooking, sewing or learning about the newest things in technology!</p>
   <h1>My Background</h1>

   </b>
  <p> I have a B.S. in Information Technology from Belford University. I am currently enrolled in Coding From Scratch and will start Coder Camps on March 20, 2017. I wanted to learn more about programming and after seeing a post on Facebook about Coder Camps, I decided to get more information. It wasn't a difficult decision, at all, to hop on the Coder's Camp train! I am so excited and optomistic about the possibilities that my new skills will provide for me!</p>
    <h1>Why I Decided To Learn Programming</h1>
    <p>I have been exposed to computers through my mother, for as long as I can remember. My mother worked for the federal government and was telling folks that computers were the future since the early 1970's! My mother wanted to make sure that all her kids had as much exposure to computers as possible. So since 1991 we have had a personal computer in our home. I attended a gifted and talented school from 2nd grade to eighth grade and we had computer classes every year! I then went to one of the top 10 high schools in the nation and this is where I was introduced to computer programming. Now granted, technology has changed a lot since my first Q Basic programming class in 1992 but, my interest in programming has only grown! My life circumstances really hadn't allowed me much of a chance to learn more in programming, until now. I am so amazed at the changes in programming and I am so ready to learn all I can about these technologies!</p>
